Briefly explain the vulnerability and why the secure version prevents the vulnerability.

`insecure.js` was vulnerable to spoofing because it does not correctly handle
session cookies by setting `httpOnly: false` which makes cookies accessible 
via client-side JavaScript. This can be exploited through Cross-Site Scripting
attacks which can allow attackers to steal users' session cookies (via a 
malicious website) to impersonate them.

`secure.js` addressing this by setting `httpOnly: true` and `sameSite: true`
for the cookies. The `sameSite: true` attribute restricts access to the session
cookie by only allowing them to be seen by the same site, reducing the risk of
Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

The two CIA properties violated are confidentiality and integrity. Spoofing
violates confidentiality by allowing unauthorized access to information that
should only be accessible to authorized users. It also compromises integrity,
as the attacker could manipulate data while impersonating an authorized user.
