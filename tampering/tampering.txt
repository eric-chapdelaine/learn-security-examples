`insecure.js` does not handle its user input correctly, leaving it vulnerable 
to attacks. When registering a new user, it directly uses the user-provided name
without sanitizing or escaping it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious
scripts into the web pages viewed by other users (Cross-Site Scripting). Since
the input is directly reflected in the response to users, an attacker could
potentially steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of other users.

`secure.js` pervents this kind of attack by sanitizing the user input with the
`escapeHTML` function before storing it. This function converts HTML blocks to
their corresponding HTML codes, which ensures that the input is treated as text
and not code. This prevents the execution of scripts.

Tampering with data violates the Integrity component of the CIA properties. 
Integrity ensures that data is accurate and untampered with. This is violated
as users can tamper with data by inserting malicious scripts.
